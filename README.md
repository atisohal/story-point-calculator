# story-point-calculator
Assign story points based on complexity, effort, risk, and dependency with options for Low, Medium, and High. Calculates points using weighted criteria (30% complexity/effort, 20% risk/dependency) and rounds to the nearest Fibonacci number (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13). Ideal for agile teams estimating task complexity.
