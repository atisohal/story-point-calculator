# Story Point Calculator

### Overview
This web-based tool calculates story points based on weighted criteria including complexity, effort, risk, and dependency. It provides options for Low, Medium, and High levels for each category, applying a weighted average (30% for complexity and effort, 20% each for risk and dependency). The calculated points are rounded to the nearest Fibonacci number (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13), offering a standardized estimation metric ideal for agile project management.

### Usage
* Select the appropriate radio buttons for each category (Complexity, Effort, Risk, Dependency).
* Click on any radio button to calculate and display the estimated story points.
* Results are displayed dynamically, showing the selected criteria and the corresponding story points.
